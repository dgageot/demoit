      Hello, World!

      <h2>Auto-reload</h2>
      <p>Have you seen how the browser was auto-refreshed?</p>
      <p>When the slide is loaded, the browser polls the url it has been given. It stops polling as soon as a non-error status code is replied.</p>

      <h2>Shell history</h2>
      <p>Inside a shell window, your shell's history is replaced with what's in <code>./.demoit/.bash_history</code>.</p>
      <p>So, you don't have to remember the <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> command. It's already in your shell's history.</p>

      <h2>Fullscreen</h2>
      <p>Any small window can be made fullscreen by clicking on its green button</p>
