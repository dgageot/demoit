<h1>Chesterton's Fence</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road.</p>
<p>The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, <em>"I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away."</em>. To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer:
</p><p><em>"If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."</em></p>
</blockquote>
